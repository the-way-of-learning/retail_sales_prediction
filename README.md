# Retail Sales Prediction MLOps Project

## Problem Statement
This application provides retail sales predictions using a machine learning model. By leveraging historical patterns from the **Online Retail Dataset** ([UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)), which contains transactional data from **01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011** for a UK-based non-store online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts, it enables accurate sales forecasting. 

As part of this assignment, we aim to understand the full lifecycle of ML model deployment, including:
- Version control
- Tracking experiments
- Building an interactive UI
